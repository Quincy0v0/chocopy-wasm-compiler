* Code and tests demonstrating that the 2 programs you chose from your proposal are working as expected


* A description of which examples will work by March 11, including any updates you want to make to the examples you plan for March 11 (it’s OK to scale back or up depending on where you got!)
    
  The ten examples we gave in our first proposal were:
    
    1. ✓ Bignum as expression
    2. ✓ Print
    3. ✓ 32 bit numbers and big numbers are the same to the programmer
    4. Addition and subtraction
    5. Division and multiplication
    6. Mod 
    7. Binary operators: == != > < >= <=
    8. Operations with differently-sized operands
    9. ✓ Typing: can't compare int and bool
    10. Big nums in memory are immutable

  We have completed 1, 2, 3, and 9. By March 11 we will complete 4, 7, 8, and 10. Division, multiplication, and the modulo operator will be stretch goals.

* A description of the biggest challenge you faced in your week of implementation

  - working with other groups since projects are inter-connected ?
